## v1.1.0 — Audio / Video (WebRTC) ⚠️ Deliberately Deferred

```
feat: proximity-triggered voice/video via WebRTC SFU
```

> **Deferred until v1.0.0 is stable.** Raw `RTCPeerConnection` doesn't scale for
> group rooms — you get N² peer connections as users grow. The right path is an
> **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)**: every client connects once, to the server,
> which forwards media streams selectively.
>
> **Recommended: LiveKit** (open source, self-hostable, Node.js SDK available).
> Signaling (`offer`, `answer`, `ice-candidate`) can reuse the existing WebSocket.
> Trigger call setup on `proximity:enter`, tear down on `proximity:leave`.

- [ ] Evaluate LiveKit vs mediasoup for SFU
- [ ] Deploy LiveKit server (Docker)
- [ ] Signaling: exchange WebRTC offer/answer/ICE via existing WS
- [ ] Auto-connect voice on `proximity:enter`
- [ ] Auto-disconnect on `proximity:leave`
- [ ] Mute/unmute button in HUD
- [ ] Spatial audio: volume falloff by tile distance (Web Audio API `GainNode`)

---

## Backlog (Unscheduled)

- [ ] Multiple floors / space transitions via door elements
- [ ] Screen share (WebRTC data channel or iframe embed)
- [ ] URL-embed triggered by computer elements
- [ ] Space templates the admin can publish (office, classroom, lounge)
- [ ] Space analytics for owners (active users over time, peak hours)
- [ ] Mobile touch controls (virtual D-pad)
- [ ] Dark mode UI
